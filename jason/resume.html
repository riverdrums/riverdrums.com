<P>Jason has been playing the piano for over 25 years, having studied at the
University of the Witwatersrand with <B>Michael Strauss</B> and <B>Regina Bodnya</B>.
He started composing electronic music after graduating. He has always had a 
fascination with the performing arts world, and this has led him to collaborate 
on many projects involving dance, theatre, public performance and fine arts.
</P>

<P>During 1991 and 1992, Jason taught music in Soweto. His first work with
theatre was with <B>Steven Berkoff</B>'s play <U>Say a prayer for me</U>, which was 
produced at the 1990 Grahamstown National Arts Festival. During 1991, he wrote the music
for the Market Theatre production of <B>Bertolt Brecht</B>'s <U>Caucasian Chalk Circle</U>, 
directed by <B>Gerrit Schoonhoven</B>. This work was produced on the main festival 
program in Grahamstown. He also worked with choreographer <B>Jeannette Ginslov</B>
on a number of dance works, including <U>VIVID</U>,  directed by <B>Andrew Buckland</B>.
</P>

<P>During 1993, Jason played in the band <B>Somewhere Else</B>, with <B>Gito Baloi</B>,
<B>Gaston Goliath</B> and <B>George Sunday</B>. This was the start of his association with Gito, 
which continued with the <U><a href='index.html'>Desert Voices</a></U> 
series of projects. Also during this year, he wrote the music for a short film, 
<U>The War Ballerina</U>, directed by<B> Melinda Ferguson</B>, and composed songs and piano 
accompaniment for <B>Shakespeare</B>'s <U>Twelfth Night</U>.
</P>

<P>
Work on commercial theatre projects followed this, including industrial theatre works. Jason 
worked with <B>Janice Honeyman</B> at the Johannesburg Civic Theatre during 1994. During 
this year, he entered two electro-acoustic works in the Bourges Competition in France. A 
further work, entitled <U>Non</U>, was entered in the same competition during 1996.
</P>

<P>
The Performing Arts Council of the Transvaal (<B>PACT</B>) commissioned original music for their
production of <B>Shakespeare</B>'s <U>Macbeth</U> during 1995. Jason performed live in the play, 
directed by <B>Craig Friemond</B>.
</P>

<P>
1996 saw Jason involved in a project with <B>Mark Odonovan</B>, a sculptor. They were 
sponsored by the Foundation for the Creative Arts, and worked on a musical sculpture
together. They had first worked together during 1995 on a project called <U>NUET</U> 
(Newtown Urban Eco Tour) for the Market Theatre in Johannesburg. This project was co-ordinated 
by a group called <B>KLAP</B>, and Jason was to work with different members of this 
group on various performance art projects over the next few years. In particular, he
worked with <B>Francois Venter</B>, <B>Vincent Meyburgh</B> and <B>Louw Venter</B> in 
a street theatre group called <B>Jungle Performance</B>.
</P>

<P><B>Jungle</B> started out as a small project, but during 1996 it toured all over
South Africa with a succession of street shows. Later in the year, two other performers, 
<B>Catherine Henegan</B> and <B>Phillippa de Villiers</B> joined to create a show, 
<U>One Country, One Picnic</U>, that toured extensively. <B>Jungle</B> utilised a mixture 
of clowning, drumming, electronic music played on portable equipment, juggling, fire and 
theatrics. Jason composed electronic music especially for performance by <B>Jungle</B>,
including the <U>3 Worship Songs</U>. 
</P>

<P>
Also during 1996, Jason composed and performed in a solo show called <U>Global Kraal</U>. This 
show was a mask and music show, using masks made by <B>Marius Meyer</B>, and featuring Jason's 
electronic compositions. Jason took this show to the Grahamstown Festival in 1996.
</P>

<P>
The <U><a href='index.html'>Desert Voices</a></U> project began in 1996 with a grant from the Foundation for 
the Creative Arts. Jason and <B>Gito Baloi</B> worked on a six song selection, totalling 
thirty minutes of music. They then produced and distributed their product.
</P>

<P>
The project continued in 2000, when the National Arts Council gave another grant to complete 
more music.  Jason and Gito produced a full length album, totalling forty minutes.
</P>

<P>
Jason started working with open-source software development during 1997, and currently consults 
and developes software in Copenhagen, Denmark.
